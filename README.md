### How to Contribute
#### Run the Development Server
The `npm run dev:hot` script starts a dev server with hot reloading enabled.
```bash
# make sure you have the latest source code
git pull origin master
# install development dependencies
npm install --save-dev
# run the dev server on port 3700
npm run dev:hot
```
Once the dev-server is running, navigate to http://localhost:3700 in your web browser.
